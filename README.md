# TravelList-Webapp

The Travel List project is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and share their favorite travel destinations. It's built using Python with Flask as the web framework, Jinja2 for templating HTML and CSS, and MongoDB as the database to store trip information. The application provides features such as adding new trips, editing trip details, searching for trips, and deleting trips. Users can also add comments and rate the trips, making it a comprehensive platform for sharing travel experiences and recommendations.
